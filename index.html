                <p>The race you choose contributes to your character&apos;s identity in an important way, by establishing a general appearance
                and the natural talents gained from culture and ancestry. Your character&apos;s race grants particular racial traits, such as
                special senses, proficiency with certain weapons or tools, proficiency in one or more skills, or the ability to use
                minor spells.</p>

                          <p>Bold and hardy, dwarves are known as skilled warriors, miners, and workers of stone and metal. Though they
                            stand well under 5 feet tall, dwarves are so broad and compact that they can weigh as much as a human standing nearly two
                            feet taller. Their courage and endurance are also easily a match for any of the larger folk.
                            Dwarven skin ranges from deep brown to a paler hue tinged with red, but the most common shades are light brown
                            or deep tan, like certain tones of earth. Their hair, worn long but in simple styles, is usually black, gray, or brown,
                            though paler dwarves often have red hair. Male dwarves value their beards highly and groom them carefully.</p>

                          lured by the open road and the wide horizon to discover the wonders of new lands and peoples. But even these wanderers

                          <p>To be greeted with stares and whispers, to suffer violence and insult on the street, to see mistrust and fear in every
                          eye: this is the lot of the tiefling. And to twist the knife, tieflings know that this is because a pact struck
                          generations ago infused the essence of Asmodeus—overlord of the Nine Hells—into their bloodline. Their appearance and
                          their nature are not their fault but the result of an ancient sin, for which they and their children and their
                          children&apos;s children will always be held accountable.</p>
