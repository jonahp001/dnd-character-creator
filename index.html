                and the natural talents gained from culture and ancestry. Your character&apos;s race grants particular racial traits, such as
                special senses, proficiency with certain weapons or tools, proficiency in one or more skills, or the ability to use
                minor spells.</p>

                          <p>Bold and hardy, dwarves are known as skilled warriors, miners, and workers of stone and metal. Though they
                            stand well under 5 feet tall, dwarves are so broad and compact that they can weigh as much as a human standing nearly two
                            feet taller. Their courage and endurance are also easily a match for any of the larger folk.</p>
                          <p>Dwarven skin ranges from deep brown to a paler hue tinged with red, but the most common shades are light brown
                          or deep tan, like certain tones of earth. Their hair, worn long but in simple styles, is usually black, gray, or brown,
                          though paler dwarves often have red hair. Male dwarves value their beards highly and groom them carefully.</p>

                          lured by the open road and the wide horizon to discover the wonders of new lands and peoples. But even these wanderers

                          <p>People of towns and cities take pride in how their civilized ways set them apart from animals, as if denying one&apos;s own
                          nature was a mark of superiority. To a barbarian, though, civilization is no virtue, but a sign of weakness. The strong
                          embrace their animal nature—keen instincts, primal physicality, and ferocious rage. Barbarians are uncomfortable when
                          hedged in by walls and crowds. They thrive in the wilds of their homelands: the tundra, jungle, or grasslands where

                          <p>Barbarians come alive in the chaos of combat. They can enter a berserk state where rage takes over, giving them

                          those few rages are usually sufficient to defeat whatever threats arise.</p>

                          <p>In the worlds of D&amp;D, words and music are not just vibrations of air, but vocalizations with power all their own. The
                          bard is a master of song, speech, and the magic they contain. Bards say that the multiverse was spoken into existence,
                          that the words of the gods gave it shape, and that echoes of these primordial Words of Creation still resound throughout
                          the cosmos. The music of bards is an attempt to snatch and harness those echoes, subtly woven into their spells and
                          powers.</p>
                          <p>The greatest strength of bards is their sheer versatility. Many bards prefer to stick to the sidelines in combat, using
                          their magic to inspire their allies and hinder their foes from a distance. But bards are capable of defending themselves
                          in melee if necessary, using their magic to bolster their swords and armor. Their spells lean toward charms and
                          illusions rather than blatantly destructive spells. They have a wide-ranging knowledge of many subjects and a natural
                          aptitude that lets them do almost anything well. Bards become masters of the talents they set their minds to perfecting,
                          from musical performance to esoteric knowledge.</p>

                          <p>Harnessing divine magic doesn&apos;t rely on study or training. A cleric might learn formulaic prayers and ancient rites, but

                          provoke awe and dread, lay curses of plague or poison, and even call down flames from heaven to consume their enemies.
                          For those evildoers who will benefit most from a mace to the head, clerics depend on their combat training to let them

                          <p>Warriors of the wilderness, rangers specialize in hunting the monsters that threaten the edges of civilization—humanoid
                          raiders, rampaging beasts and monstrosities, terrible giants, and deadly dragons. They learn to track their quarry as a
                          predator does, moving stealthily through the wilds and hiding themselves in brush and rubble. Rangers focus their combat
                          training on techniques that are particularly useful against their specific favored foes.</p>
                          <p>Thanks to their familiarity with the wilds, rangers acquire the ability to cast spells that harness nature&apos;s power, much
                          as a druid does. Their spells, like their combat abilities, emphasize speed, stealth, and the hunt. A ranger&apos;s talents
                          and abilities are honed with deadly focus on the grim task of protecting the borderlands.</p>

                          <p>Rogues devote as much effort to mastering the use of a variety of skills as they do to perfecting their combat
                          abilities, giving them a broad expertise that few other characters can match. Many rogues focus on stealth and
                          deception, while others refine the skills that help them in a dungeon environment, such as climbing, finding and
                          disarming traps, and opening locks.</p>
                          <p>When it comes to combat, rogues prioritize cunning over brute strength. A rogue would rather make one precise strike,
                          placing it exactly where the attack will hurt the target most, than wear an opponent down with a barrage of attacks.
                          Rogues have an almost supernatural knack for avoiding danger, and a few learn magical tricks to supplement their other
                          abilities.</p>

                          <p>Magic is a part of every sorcerer, suffusing body, mind, and spirit with a latent power that waits to be tapped. Some
                          sorcerers wield magic that springs from an ancient bloodline infused with the magic of dragons. Others carry a raw,
                          uncontrolled magic within them, a chaotic storm that manifests in unexpected ways.</p>
                          <p>The appearance of sorcerous powers is wildly unpredictable. Some draconic bloodlines produce exactly one sorcerer in
                          every generation, but in other lines of descent every individual is a sorcerer. Most of the time, the talents of sorcery
                          appear as apparent flukes. Some sorcerers can&apos;t name the origin of their power, while others trace it to strange events
                          in their own lives. The touch of a demon, the blessing of a dryad at a baby&apos;s birth, or a taste of the water from a
                          mysterious spring might spark the gift of sorcery. So too might the gift of a deity of magic, exposure to the elemental
                          forces of the Inner Planes or the maddening chaos of Limbo, or a glimpse into the inner workings of reality.</p>
                          <p>Sorcerers have no use for the spellbooks and ancient tomes of magic lore that wizards rely on, nor do they rely on a
                          patron to grant their spells as warlocks do. By learning to harness and channel their own inborn magic, they can
                          discover new and staggering ways to unleash that power.</p>

                          <p>A warlock is defined by a pact with an otherworldly being. Sometimes the relationship between warlock and patron is like
                          that of a cleric and a deity, though the beings that serve as patrons for warlocks are not gods. A warlock might lead a
                          cult dedicated to a demon prince, an archdevil, or an utterly alien entity—beings not typically served by clerics. More
                          often, though, the arrangement is similar to that between a master and an apprentice. The warlock learns and grows in
                          power, at the cost of occasional services performed on the patron&apos;s behalf.</p>
                          <p>The magic bestowed on a warlock ranges from minor but lasting alterations to the warlock&apos;s being (such as the ability to
                          see in darkness or to read any language) to access to powerful spells. Unlike bookish wizards, warlocks supplement their
                          magic with some facility at hand-to-hand combat. They are comfortable in light armor and know how to use simple weapons.</p>

                          Some aspire to become like the gods, shaping reality itself. Though the casting of a typical spell requires merely the
                          utterance of a few strange words, fleeting gestures, and sometimes a pinch or clump of exotic materials, these surface
                          components barely hint at the expertise attained after years of apprenticeship and countless hours of study.</p>

                          (such as the fey) that are steeped in magic.</p>
